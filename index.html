Oh, thank you for making me holy And thank you for giving me holes to choose from And since I'm not a Godless whore He'll have to come in the back door Therefore Fuck me in the ass 'cause I love Jesus The good Lord would want it that way Gimme that sweet sensation of a throbbing rationalization It's just between you and me 'Cause everyone knows it's the sex that God can't see It's hard to be as pure as me To resist the urge to lose my vaginal virginity To wait until my marriage bed To give my husband my unsullied maidenhead So take your cock out Shove it in my ass Fuck me until you cum Oops! I mean let's join our souls and unite our bodies And fly with the wings of God Whatever you do, don't touch my clitoris If you ring Satan's doorbell, God can't ignore this And no prophylactics when you put it in 'Cause birth control's for sluts and it's a sin I've emptied my bowels And laid out the towels I'm ready for romance Now I'm praying to the Power that's the Highest But of all of my holes, this one's the driest And we can't procreate if we anally copulate And God's OK with sodomy, but only if you're straight And I'm staying pure, no matter what")
